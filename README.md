A library to generate cryptographically secure shares of a secret.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add react-native-sssa react-native-securerandom react-native-aes-crypto react-native-secure-storage
$ react-native link
```

[react-native-securerandom] is used to provide entropy in shamir's secret sharing algorithm 

[react-native-aes-crypto] is used to encrypt a file with AES before being encrypted with SSSA

[react-native-secure-storage] is used to securely stored the private key
